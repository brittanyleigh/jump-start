# Assignment: Breaking Down Identity

Our identities are complicated. We carry with us many different affinities, including race, sexuality, ethnicity, religion, and class, just to name a few. Some parts of ourselves may garner privilege, while others may be culturally marginalized.  We can use the term “intersectionality” to refer to this understanding of multiplicity.

Please answer the following reflection questions on a separate paper.

1. List as many of your own identity categories as you can: (e.g. race, class, gender, age, religion, education, family structure, etc)

White
Female
Traditional nuclear family
(Childhood)
Catholic
Lower-middle class
Oldest sibling
Smartest sibling
Above average student
Above average education
Above average artistic talent
(Adulthood)
Independent female
Introvert
Solo-preneur
Upper-middle class
Atheist/Agnostic
Jeweler
Creative
Childfree


2. Which part of your identity are you most aware of on a daily basis?
Independent female - it's impossible to go a day without being reminded that I am a 30 year old female who is unique because I am not married and a mother of two with a house in the suburbs at this age. I chose to follow my heart in life and it has taken me down a path with an unknown, unpredictable future. It's both exhilariating and terrifying.


3. Which part of your identity are you least aware of on a daily basis?
My religion and spirituality. It's not something I think about of my own accord very often, and I don't generally find myself in conversations regarding religion. 


4. Which part of your identity was the most emphasized growing up?
My artistic talent. I was always encouraged to pursue whatever endeavors interested me, and I was always praised for my art. It became a huge part of who I was, so much so that I went to art school for college. Sometimes I'm not sure if it was the best path for me at the time, but it led me to where I am now so I can't really say I regret it.

5. Which part of your identity do you feel is the most misunderstood?
Solo-preneur. I've started a business, and I quit my job to focus on it. So people seem to think I have it all figured out. But I never know how to honestly answer the question "So how is it going?" because the truthful answer is "It's so fucking hard". Each day that goes by, I become more and more confident that this is not a good fit for me. But I'm still figuring out what's next, and my career change is such a personal decision and journey for me that I don't feel line unravelling my reasoning for every person who asks how I am. 


6. Which part of your identity do you feel is the most difficult to discuss with those who identify differently?
I've always had a difficult time explaining my spirituality. My Catholic education has jaded me to the point that I really don't identify with an organized religion. I'm not even sure if God exists, but I choose to believe that there is something other than dumb luck guiding us. But what exactly is that? How do I envision it? I don't even really know. I only believe that each of us will find our way to where we are meant to be, I just can't quite explain how. 


7. Which part of your identity grants you the most privilege?
I definitely feel that being a white person from a traditional, nuclear family that has financial security has given me more opportunities in my life than the average person. I'm not oblivious to the fact that my father worked hard his entire life to build a business that could supply my family the means to pursue our dreams and passions, and I am forever grateful to have been born into that privilege.


8. Which part of your identity feels the most marginalized?
I constantly feel judged and looked down on for being a 30 year old woman who doesn't have children and has no immediate desire to have them. For me, there are so many reasons NOT to have a child. But it's always assumed that it's just something you do as a woman, no one ever stops to question why they're becoming mothers.
