#Assignment: Reflection One
*Brief responses are just fine.*

1. List at least 5 examples of institutional racism. Try to come up with these independently, but use google if needed.

  *    Blacks, especially young men, receive exponentially harsher sentences for relatively minor crimes in the judicial system
  *    Charter schools often discriminate based on race, creating a pattern of leaving minorities in low quality public schools
  *    Traffic violations/police profiling - people being pulled over for no reason other than the color their skin, ticketed for minor violations more often
  *    The fact that it took our country 3 centuries to elect a black president
  *    Job applicants not being considered simply for having a black sounding name

1. What, if anything, was a new concept to you in this section? Does this raise any further questions for you?

   The article about intersectionality and privilege really spoke to me, because it gave me a new perspective on my own privilege.   
   I've always been aware that I have led a very privileged life, simply because I'm white, middle class, and well-educated. I've never really personally felt oppressed, so I've always felt out of place and awkward joining any kind of fight against oppression. How can I be of help if I don't have the personal experiences to relate?   
   Then I realized, especially when I read the following quote, that my privilege is exactly why I should join the fight. Because my privilege shouldn't be a privilege at all, it should be the standard for everyone.   
   "If privilege guilt prevents me from acting against oppression, then it is simply another tool of oppression."
