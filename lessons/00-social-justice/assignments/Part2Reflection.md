#Assignment: Reflection One
*Brief responses are just fine.*

1. List at least 5 examples of institutional racism. Try to come up with these independently, but use google if needed.

1. What, if anything, was a new concept to you in this section? Does this raise any further questions for you?

  The article about intersectionality and privilege really spoke to me, because it gave me a new perspective on my own privilege. 
   I've always been aware that I have led a very privileged life, simply because I'm white, middle class, and well-educated. I've never really personally felt oppressed, so I've always felt out of place and awkward joining any kind of fight against oppression. How can I be of help if I don't have the personal experiences to relate?
   Then I realized, especially when I read the following quote, that my privilege is exactly why I should join the fight. Because my privilege shouldn't be a privilege at all, it should be the standard for everyone. 
   "If privilege guilt prevents me from acting against oppression, then it is simply another tool of oppression."
