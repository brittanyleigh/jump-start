# Assignment: Things to Try

While you are completing the jumpstart curriculum, try out various strategies for learning (see the notes for examples). After each lesson think about how good you feel about your understanding of that material and relate that understanding to the strategies that you tried.

+ Try to identify your preferred learning style(s).
Before even starting the jumpstart curriculum, I feel like I have a pretty good idea of my preferred learning sytles. I think there's something to be gained from all four styles, and that it's impossible not to utitlize all of them in at least some small way as you learn new things. 

But at this moment, I would say first and foremost I am a Kinesthetic learner. I love to learn by doing things, and I find I retain information so much better after I have figured out how to do it myself. It's important to me to try and fail, to make the mistakes, and to finally succeed in the end. It's a multi-stepped process, and each step teaches me something important.

My second preferred style is Visual, I'm much more drawn to visual representations than audio or text. If shown a chart of data, I can recall much better the facts about the data because the colors and shapes are connected to the information in my mind. Audio and text get more mixed up and blurry in my memory.

Auditory and read/write are my least preferred methods of learning. I remember in certain classes in high school, I would even kind of space out listening to a lecture. I'd stop paying attention but then go home and work through the content in a more visual or kinesthetic way, and then ace the exams. Even then I recognized that I needed to learn things in a way that worked for me personally. 


+ Try to identify which strategies work well for you.
